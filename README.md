## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Background-Color-Changer.git
````

2. **Navigate to the folder:**

   ```bash
   cd Background-Color-Changer
   ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your browser.**

---

## 🧠 How It Works

* HTML defines the structure with color buttons using `<span>` elements.
* CSS styles the layout and color blocks.
* JavaScript adds event listeners to buttons that change the page’s `backgroundColor` and `color` based on the clicked button’s `id`.

---

## 💡 Sample Usage

Click on any of the colored buttons (e.g., 🔴 Red or 🔵 Blue) and see the background instantly change.
